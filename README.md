Log-in and user registration pages that registered users can use to log-in the web application.

For my project, I chose to build a church's web application. Since the global pandemic, churches have adopted the use of websites to reach out to their members.
Members can now access sermons online or watch live sermons and programs without being there physically, or their location can help them know branches closest to them.
The church also uses the database as a way to keep records of their members. This is what motivated me to choose a church website for my project.

Before proceeding to create my web pages, I made sketches on the user registration and log in web pages.
I created three web pages. The first one is the Log In page saved as 'loginp.php', the second page is the User Registration page saved as 'registration.php' and the third one being 
the Home page saved as 'homepage.php' with their corresponding css files('loginp.css', 'homepage.css', 'userregistration.css').
'server.php' is the file that connects the web pages to the database(church_operations.sql).
